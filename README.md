# How MVP works

## [Tokenization](pplx://action/followup)

- Carbon credits minted as unique NFTs
- Ensures verifiability and prevents double-counting

## [Verification and Transparency](pplx://action/followup)

- NFTs contain embedded verification data
  - Proves authenticity
  - Demonstrates environmental impact
- Real-time transparency dashboard
  - Tracks credit lifecycle

## [Authorized Minting](pplx://action/followup)
